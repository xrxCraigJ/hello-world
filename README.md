# Project: hello-world
A hello world project to help give Craig Johnson some experience playing around with GitHub.

# Introduction
My first GitHub repository and project.  I want to use this repository as a place to learn how to do things with Git and the GitHub system.  I hope that I can use this as a way to learn new technologies.
